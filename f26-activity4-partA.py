# SCENARIO
# You are wanting to save money for a particular purchase.
# Write a program that estimates how long it will take to grow your money to your desired amount.
# Consider 


# TODO 1: Create inputs for the following information 
#         - Your desired savings goal
#         - The amount of money as your base investment
#         - The annual interest rate
#         - The amount of money you want to deposit into the account every month (if any)
savings_goal = float(input("What is your desired savings goal? $"))
base_investment = float(input("What is your base investment? $"))
interest_rate = float(input("What is the percentage of the annual interest rate? "))
monthly_deposit = float(input("How much do you want to deposit into the account every month? $"))

# TODO 2: Create variables to hold number of months and current balance of the account
number_of_months = 0
account_balance = base_investment

# TODO 3: Create a loop that will run until you have made at least your desired savings goal
while account_balance < savings_goal:

    # TODO 4: Calculate amount of money earned that month through interest on your base investment and monthly deposit
    interest_earned = account_balance * (interest_rate / 100 / 12)
    account_balance = account_balance + interest_earned + monthly_deposit

    # TODO 5: Increment the number of times the loop has run so you can track how many months it takes to hit your goal
    number_of_months += 1

# TODO 6:  Print how long it will take for your investment to mature.  
#          If the duration is longer than 12 months, print your result in years.  Otherwise, print the result in months.75
print("GOAL: $" + format(savings_goal, ".2f") +
      "\nINTEREST: " + str(interest_rate) + "%" +
      "\nBASE: $" + format(base_investment, ".2f") +
      "\nMONTHLY DEPOSIT: $" + format(monthly_deposit, ".2f") +
      "\n")
if number_of_months > 12:
    number_of_years = number_of_months / 12
    print("Number of Years: " + str(number_of_years))
else:
    print("Number of Months: " + str(number_of_months))
print("Total Investment: $" + format(account_balance, ".2f"))

# EXPECTED OUTPUT
# GOAL: $1,000,000
# INTEREST: 4%
# BASE: $1,000
# MONTHLY DEPOSIT: $100
#
# Number of Months: 177
# Number of Years: 87.75
# Total Investment: $1,034,906.36
