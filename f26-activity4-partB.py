# SCENARIO
# You are developing a registration system for a small event
# The organizers have a list of registered attendees and need to check whether someone is permitted to enter.

registered_guests = [
    "Alice",
    "Bob"
]


# TODO 1: Create a while loop thap that continues until all guests are checked in.
checked_in_guests = []
while len(checked_in_guests) < len(registered_guests):

    # TODO 2: Ask the user to enter their name
    guest_name = input("What is your name? ").capitalize()

    # TODO 3: Iterate through guest list and check whether their name appears in the registered guests list
    if guest_name in registered_guests:

    # TODO 4: If registered and they're not already in checked in, add their name to the checked-in list and print a welcome message
        if guest_name not in checked_in_guests:
            checked_in_guests.append(guest_name)
            print("Welcome, " + guest_name + "!")
        else:
            print(guest_name + ", you are already checked in.")

    # TODO 5: Otherwise, Display an appropriate message for unregistered guests
    else:
        print("Sorry, " + guest_name + ", your name isn't on the list.")

    # TODO 6: Print the updated checked-in list
    print("Checked-in guests: ", checked_in_guests)

# TODO 7: Print a message telling us that all guests have successfully checked in!
print("All guests have been checked in!")

# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
# [ "Alice", "Bob"]
# What is your name:  "Alice"
#    Welcome Alice!
